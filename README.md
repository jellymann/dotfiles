# Dotfiles
My environment configuration files for shell, tmux and vim.
I work in OS X so I can't guarantee this will work on other *nix derivatives.

Once upon a time I typed something to the likes of <br>
`$ my-config-setting > ~/.zshrc` <br>
instead of <br>
`$ my-config-setting >> ~/.zshrc` <br>
and overwrote my config.

Never again.

## Usage
Clone the repo somewhere on your machine, copy what you want into your home directory.

## Contents

### .zshrc
Slightly modified version of .oh-my-zsh with some handy aliases.

### .tmux.conf
I'm new to tmux so this will be evolving soon. But it's got some basic stuff to be more seemless with vim.

### .vimrc
I'm most proud of this, especially thanks to [Kevin](https://github.com/kmckelvin) for his help on this one.

### .gitconfig
Random git config, basically for me.
